# Setup Build Images
Every time EDRC checks your board it captures an image of the board. You can view this image in EDRC and embed in it your website or wiki. This guide shows you how.

> Want to show off the status of your DRC, not images of your boards? Check out the [build status image guide](/guides/build-status-image).
