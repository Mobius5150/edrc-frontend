# Suggest New Design Rules
EDRC will accept design rules from any manufacturer, provided they are submitted directly by the manufacturer or the DRU file is available from their official website. Note that DRU files in EDRC are inherently public and cannot be made private. We will happily link back to your website if we do host your rules.

Please use the form below to suggest new design rules that should be added to EDRC.
