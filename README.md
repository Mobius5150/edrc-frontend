# Getting Started
First, ensure that you have the backend server running locally or are proxying to the cloud [backend service](https://git.michaelblouin.ca/edrc/edrc-backend). Then start by running these two commands in parallel:
 - `npm run watch-css`
 - `npm run start`

You may need to login to the site first by goign to `http://localhost:3001/auth/github` (assuming the backend is running on port `3001`).

The second command will open your browser to the local development server and you're off to the races. Change files locally to make changes!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
